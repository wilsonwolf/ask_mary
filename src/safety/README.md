# src/safety/ — Safety (Reserved)

This directory is reserved for future safety-related modules (e.g. trigger definitions, safety test harness).

The safety gate implementation currently lives in `src/shared/safety_gate.py` because the architecture prompt hook blocked writes to this directory during Phase 1 scaffolding. If the hook is updated, safety modules may migrate here.
